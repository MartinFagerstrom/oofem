/**
 * Abstract base class representing integration rule. The integration rule is
 * a collection of integration points used to  numerically integrate some formula.
 * The number of integration points and their coordinates and integration weights depends on
 * integration rule type (rule for integration in 1d, 2d, 3d) and required  accuracy.
 * General services for initialization are declared. Services for integration point retrieval are provided.
 *
 * In general, finite elements can have multiple integration rules, for different tasks or
 * when some components are integrated using reduced or selective integration.
 * Therefore, first and last index variables are introduced to characterize components
 * for which given integration rule applies.
 *
 * The integration rule is a rather passive object. It does not perform numerical
 * integration - it just provide way how to set up correct integration points
 * and weights.
 *
 * Because integration points contain related history parameters (using material status),
 * the unique copy of integration rule must exist on each element. The integration rule is
 * exclusively possessed by particular finite element.
 *
 *
 * Tasks:
 * - instanciating yourself
 * - returning number of integration points used
 * - returning requested integration point - method getIntegrationPoint
 * - returning interval of components (i.e.of local strain vector), where apply
 * - returning array of gauss points, according to specific
 *   integration rule (Gauss rule, Newton-Cotes rule, ...).
 *   integration points and corresponding weights are stored in Gauss point class.
 * - printing yourself
 * - updating yourself
 * - initializing for new time step
 * - saving & restoring context
